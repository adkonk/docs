# Housing

Most Churchill postgrads stay in the hostels, which are a series of houses along Storey's Way.
I lived in Whittingehame Cottage, which is a small appendage off the much larger Whittingehame Lodge.
The cottage housed three people with 1.5 shared bathrooms, and each room had a single bed and no basin (sink).
I strongly disliked this residence because it lacked any common space and felt extremely small.
The kitchen was microscopic.

Several of my friends lived in the larger hostels, especially 76 Storey's Way and Pinchin-Riley House.
76 seemed fairly nice when I visited, but it's definitely much older.
Maybe they've renovated since, because Churchill has been renovating a few of the hostels each year lately.
Whittingehame and Pinchin were both renovated when I was there, which is nice because the building feels newer but I also think the style of renovation that Churchill college uses makes the hostels feel a bit sterile.
I never visited because only one person lived there my year, but I was told that 70 Storey's Way was very nice after its renovations and several of my friends agreed that they would have chosen it as their top pick if they could go back.

There is a small amount of postgrad housing that's similar to the undergrad housing, which is called a staircase.
I knew one guy who lived in the postgrad staircase and I think he liked it, though you get a different experience from the hostels and it probably feels more like a dorm or apartment building.
I'd suggest a hostel instead.

A few of my friends lived in these apartment-like building called the Pepperpots, where each person gets their own bedroom with personal bathroom and there are shared kitchen spaces.
I think they liked those, though living there seemed less social than the hostels.
The Pepperpot flats are a lot more expensive from what I remember.
All of the hostels have cleaning staff that come through twice a week and maintain the bathrooms, kitchens, hallways, etc (I think they're called bedders).
The housekeepers for my building were delightful and very thorough, so I didn't mind having shared bathrooms at all.

A few more small notes:
* UK single beds are even smaller than US twin beds, which should honestly be an international crime.
I am tall at 6'3" and half my shins would hang off the bottom of the bed even when my head was pushing into the headboard.
I didn't have a choice because I emphasized that I especially wanted a room with a double when I emailed Rebecca about housing, but I was unlucky and didn't get one.
If you're large, you may want to prioritize getting a double bed if possible.
It's more expensive but it can make life much more pleasant.
* I think Pinchin had paid laundry, which is silly. My house had free laundry.
* Living farther down Storey's Way can be a little annoying to walk to the college each time, or to unlock your bike and take it down to the college whenever you want to do something.
The lower the building numbers go, the farther away it is from college. 
Another reason 70 is a solid choice.
* Buildings in England have many fire doors, so be ready to open and close a lot of doors wherever you live.
* After spending a year there, I think there is substantial value in not being cheap about what room you get.
I don't think this is a year when you should try to save money.

# MCR/Social life
The Churchill MCR is really vibrant, and known for being one of the best MCRs in the university.
There is a bar upstairs in the college which typically has people there, and is busy pretty much every weekend.
I'd highly recommend going often and making a lot of friends there, it's a very great community.
If you're in less social accommodations than the hostels, this is the way to get socially involved.
